## Gesturing Framework
This asset allows you to create detectable, customizable gestures to place into your Unity scenes. Currently compatible with the Oculus Rift with Touch Controllers

#### Discrete Gesture Monitoring
Gesturing/DiscreteGesturing/Assets/Scenes/

The Discrete Gesture sample checks for gesture occurance after holding then releasing the primary index trigger on the right hand touch controller.

#### Continuous Gesture Monitoring
Gesturing/ContinuousGesturing/Assets/Scenes/

This ContinuousGestureMonitoring class continuously checks for gestures to occur. The available scene is currently setup for mouse input, but is available as a proof of concept, laying the groundwork for future development.

## UI Framework
There will be multiple projects showcasing each element individually as well as a single project that has all of the UI elements bundled into one project under its Assetes folder. The UI-All-In-One is the recommended project to download for testing out the elements.

Additionally, under the Scripts folder of each project are some scripts that you can attach to any object that affect how the object interacts with regards to the headset view.

#### GUI Elements
Buttons, Sliders, Dropdown menus, Dials, and a Keyboard

#### Attachable scripts
Scaling, Pivoting, and Relative visibility
